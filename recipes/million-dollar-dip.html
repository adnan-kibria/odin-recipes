    <h2>Description of Million Dollar Dip</h2><br>
    <p>
        Formerly known as 'Neiman Marcus dip,' this million dollar dip tastes just
        like it sounds. I've had more than a few cheesy dips in my day, but this is by
        far the richest and most delicious one yet! Served with crackers and garnished
        with green onions and bacon, this dip is sure to be a huge hit at your next party.

        <li>1 ½ cups mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>

        <li>Toast almonds in a saucepan over medium heat until lightly golden.</li>
        <li>
            Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
            occasionally, until crispy and evenly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and
            cool slightly before chopping into bits.

            Combine mayonnaise and Cheddar cheese in a mixing bowl. Toss in bacon,
            green onions, almonds, and cayenne. Stir with a spatula until combined.
            Wrap and chill in the fridge at least 1 hour before transferring to a
