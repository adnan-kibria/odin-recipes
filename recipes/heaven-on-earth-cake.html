    <h3>Ingredients</h3><br>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) purchased angel food cake, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling, divided</li>
        <li>1 (3.4 ounce) package vanilla instant pudding mix and pie filling (such as Jell-OÂ®)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk or half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
        <li>sliced almonds (optional)</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h3>Steps</h3><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>
            Place half of angel food cake pieces in the bottom of a deep 8-x-8-inch  or
            9x9-inch baking dish in an even layer. Spread 1 cup cherry pie filling over
            top of cake. Top with remaining cake pieces in an even layer. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together vanilla pudding mix, whole milk, and sour cream in a large
            bowl until slightly thickened and smooth, about 1 minute. 
        </li>
        <li>Pour pudding mix over top of cake and spread evenly.</li>
        <li>
            Spread thawed whipped topping over pudding layer. Dot with remaining 1 cup
            cherry pie filling. Using a toothpick or spoon, swoop and swirl pie filling
            into the whipped topping. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 8 hours or
            up to 12 hours. Garnish with sliced almonds.
